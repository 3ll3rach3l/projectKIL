## Brief explanation of what the app is and does

Destructables is a place where destroyers from all walks of life can come together and share their hard-earned destructive knowledge.

Users can view projects created by others, create their own projects, and interact with the destructive community via discussion boards on each project. 

Each project contains a number of steps and images to aid in your destructions, along with a list of supplies you may require.
