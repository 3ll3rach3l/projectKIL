# GAME PLAN

Goals for Monday 8/10 from feature-list.md:

* start on the project feature backend (including testing)
* then move to project feature frontend (including testing)
* once we tackle that, work on user auth
* our main goals for monday are to 'finish' the project feature (at least a working skeleton) and finish user auth.
* **see feature-list.md for more details**
